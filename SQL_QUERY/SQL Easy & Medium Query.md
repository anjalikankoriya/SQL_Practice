# SQL QUERY PRACTICE

The aim of this repository is to help learners and professionals who want to improve and grow their SQL knowledge for their careers. I thought (https://www.sql-practice.com) the website was user-friendly and informative, but neither GitHub nor the website released the entire solution book. As a result, you may now find answers to each problem and alternative options.

The test contains 52 questions and consists of three categories:

- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

You can use the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to figure out what data to store, the entities, their attributes, and how entities relate to other entities.


## Section: Easy

1. Show first name, last name, and gender of patients whose gender is 'M'

```bash
SELECT first_name, last_name, gender FROM patients where gender = 'M';
```
2. Show first name and last name of patients who does not have allergies. (null).

```bash
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM patients where allergies is null;
```
3. Show first name of patients that start with the letter 'C'

```bash
SELECT first_name FROM patients where first_name like 'C%';
```
4. Show first name and last name of patients that weight within the range of 100 to 120 (inclusive).

```bash
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM patients where weight between 100 and 120 ;

```bash
 update patients set allergies = 'NKA' where allergies is null;
```

```bash
select concat(first_name,' ', last_name) as Full_NAME from patients;
```
7. Show first name, last name, and the full province name of each patient.
Example: 'Ontario' instead of 'ON'

```bash

select first_name, last_name, birth_date from patients where height > 160
and weight > 70;
```

select distinct year(birth_date)as years from patients 
order by years asc;
```
2. Show unique first names from the patients table which only occurs once in the list. For example, if two or more people are named 'John' in the first_name column then don't include their name in the output list. If only 1 person is named 'Leo' then include them in the output.

```bash
select first_name from patients group by first_name having

```
3. Show patient_id and first_name from patients where their first_name start and ends with 's' and is at least 6 characters long.

join admissions as A on P.patient_id = A.patient_id  where 
diagnosis = 'Dementia';
```
5. Display every patient's first_name. Order the list by the length of each name and then by alphbetically.

```bash
select first_name from patients order by length(first_name), first_name;

6. Show the total amount of male patients and the total amount of female patients in the patients table. Display the two results in the same row.

```bash
select(select count(*) from patients where gender = 'M') as Male,
(select count(*) from patients where gender = 'F') as Female;
```
```bash 
SELECT 
  SUM(Gender = 'M') as male_count, 
  SUM(Gender = 'F') AS female_count
FROM patients;
